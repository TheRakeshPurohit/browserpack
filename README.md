# Browserpack

## Motivation

codesandbox and stackblitz has proved that browsers can do more than imagined and there are more possiblities out there if we can build a bundler that works fully on the browser.

## Why not use SystemJs

Yup I tried using SystemJs but it feels very less flexible and often not so well documented
